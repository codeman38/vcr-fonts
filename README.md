# Unnamed VCR Font

Resurrecting fonts from the datasheets for old OSD chips. Whee!

Directory structure is as follows:

* `sources` - Original source datasheets, together with images extracted
  from them via the `pdfimages` command.

* `scripts` - Scripts for doing the conversion.

* `raw` - Raw 1BPP binary data parsed from the datasheet images using
  `scripts/parse_bitmaps.py` with the default parameters.
